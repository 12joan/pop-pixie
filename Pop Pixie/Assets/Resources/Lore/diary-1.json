  "Text": "(According to the date, this diary entry was written a few months after the Menotes corporation was founded.)\n\nI’ve finally surpassed my expectations and created a product and a brand that have led to the development of a multimillion-dollar company.\n\nWhat thanks do I get? All my employees abandon me.\n\nThey say they don’t trust someone who’s questionably human. And then, they have the audacity to demand yet more pay rises.\n\nIt's not like I'm running a minimum-wage workhouse! Over the past few months, the pay rises I've already given them total to more than some workers manage to gain over their whole careers.\n\nNo one—certainly not any of my competitors who they seem so eager to run off to—has put as much time and effort as I have into improving employee welfare, diversity, eradicating the pay gap…\n\nBut they don't care. So much for the workplace family etiquette and what have you. Maybe I can find a replacement. If humans won't appreciate what I've done for them, then maybe something else will."
