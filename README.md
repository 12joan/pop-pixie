# Pop Pixie

Pop Pixie is the successor to our BAFTA-nominated online game, [Mouse Trapped](https://github.com/12joan/mouse_trapped). Like Mouse Trapped, we entered Pop Pixie into the BAFTA Young Game Designers competition. 

The game revolves around the adventures of the Pop Pixie, a vigilante corner shop owner whose mission it is to infiltrate the evil Menotes corporation, discover its secrets and take down the Mentoes' Man. 

## Play online

If you're smart enough to not run executables from developers you don't know, you can play Pop Pixie in your browser on our GitHub Pages site.

## Installing

Because Unity is magic, we can provide builds of Pop Pixie for Linux, Mac and Windows. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/12joan/pop-pixie/releases/latest) for your operating system and have fun!

## Building

Pop Pixie is written in [Unity 2018.3.7](https://unity3d.com/pt/unity/whats-new/2018.3.7). While it's entirely possible that the game will work with a later version, I can't guarantee it. Earlier versions? No chance. 

To play the game, download Unity, download the project, open the project in Unity and click Build and Run.
